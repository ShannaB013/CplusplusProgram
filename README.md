This is Project 3 for CS 210: In my code, I created a way to display a menu that lets you select 1 to look up a singular item's frequency shown in the list given, 
2 to show the frequency of each item shown in the list, 3 to show the frequency of each item in the list with an '*'
instead of a number, or 4 to exit the program. 
What did you do particularly well?
I was able to create a program that gave me the choice to either find the frequency of a singular item or to find the frequency of all the items in the list. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could have made my exit program code better to where I did not have to press a key to exit but to instead exit automatically.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Getting my code to read the file for the item list, I had error messages popping up when I tried running my program but for some reason could not figure out what I did wrong to
prevent the file from reading. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
One skill that would definitely be transferrable would be being able to work with files and implement them into my code. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I did this by applying OOP within my code.
